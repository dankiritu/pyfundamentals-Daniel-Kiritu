Python Fundamentals 

Overview

This repository contains solutions to a Python Coding covering fundamental Python concepts such as functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
The project demonstrates basic Python functionality through a series of tasks designed to test the understanding of Python syntax.

Repository Structure

The repository contains the following:
1.app.py: The main Python file with the implementations for all the required tasks.
2.README.md: Documentation for the project, including instructions for setup and usage.
3.Topics Covered
4.Basic Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
5.Functions: Creation of custom functions and using decorators.
6.Sequences: Sorting, slicing, and manipulating sequences.
7.Sets & Dictionaries: Operations on sets and merging dictionaries.
8.Object-Oriented Programming: Creating classes and using methods.

Tasks Implemented
add_numbers(num1, num2):

Returns the sum of num1 and num2.
is_even(number):

Returns True if the number is even, otherwise returns False.
reverse_string(text):

Reverses the input string text.
count_vowels(text):

Counts the vowels in the input string text (case-insensitive).
calculate_factorial(n):

Calculates and returns the factorial of n.
apply_decorator(func):

Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before executing the input function func.
sort_by_age(people):

Sorts a list of tuples (name, age) by age in ascending order.
merge_dicts(dict1, dict2):

Merges two dictionaries. If a key exists in both, their values are summed.
Car class:

Defines a Car class with attributes make, model, and year, and a method display_info() to print the car's details.
